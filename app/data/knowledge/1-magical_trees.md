# Care for Magical Trees

Elven trees need moonlight and drops of morning dew. Once a week, you should sing them gentle songs. Magical trees grow
slowly but bear amazing fruits after 3 years.

## Advanced Tree Whispering Techniques

The most experienced elven gardeners have discovered that magical trees respond particularly well to poetry recited in
ancient Elvish during thunderstorms. However, be warned: trees that receive too much dramatic poetry tend to develop
overly theatrical personalities and may refuse to bear fruit unless properly applauded. Some elder trees have been known
to demand standing ovations before dropping their magical acorns.

## Troubleshooting Common Tree Problems

If your magical tree starts glowing purple instead of its usual silver, this typically indicates it has been gossiping
too much with the neighboring pixie bushes. The cure is simple: place a small mirror at its base so it can admire itself
instead of chatting. Trees suffering from "branch droop syndrome" usually just need a good pep talk and perhaps a tiny
tree-sized hammock to boost their spirits. Remember, a happy tree is a productive tree, and an unhappy tree might just
pack up its roots and relocate to your neighbor's garden out of spite.
