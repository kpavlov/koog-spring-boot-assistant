# Valley of Light

The Valley of Light is located beyond the Blue Mountains, near the Moonlight Lake. Light elves live there, and all
harvest festivals are celebrated in this valley.

## The Peculiar Properties of Valley Light

The light in this valley has some rather unusual characteristics that newcomers often find bewildering. During midday,
the light becomes so bright that it actually makes shadows glow, leading to the common sight of confused visitors trying
to hide in what they think is shade, only to find themselves even more illuminated. The evening light has a tendency to
make everything look like it's been painted in watercolors, which is delightful until you realize you can't tell the
difference between a rock and a very still rabbit.

## Festival Traditions and Local Customs

The annual Harvest of Giggles festival is the valley's most cherished tradition, where light elves compete to see who
can make the most ridiculous shadow puppets using the valley's magical illumination. Local etiquette dictates that
visitors must wear at least three different shades of sparkly clothing, and it's considered terribly rude to cast a
shadow that isn't at least mildly entertaining. The valley's light elves have developed an entire language of shadow
gestures, though most conversations end up being about how lovely everyone looks in the perpetual golden hour lighting.
