# Teleportation and Portals

Portals serve as magical gateways that enable instant travel between distant locations, eliminating the need for lengthy
journeys across treacherous terrain. They provide a convenient means of transportation for wizards, merchants, and
adventurers who need to traverse vast distances quickly while avoiding the perils of conventional travel.

Portals open with crystal energy spells. If a portal gets stuck halfway, try bringing a lamp made of pure crystal and
recite the spell three times. Never place a cat nearby.

## Portal Etiquette and Safety Guidelines

When using public portals, always knock three times before entering, as you never know who might be coming through from
the other side - portal collisions are not only embarrassing but can result in temporarily sharing each other's memories
for up to a week. It's considered proper portal etiquette to bring a small gift for the destination, such as a flower or
a shiny pebble, as portals appreciate being acknowledged for their hard work. Advanced portal users recommend wearing
your second-best robes when traveling, as portal magic has an unfortunate tendency to turn clothing inside-out, and you
don't want to arrive at important meetings looking disheveled.

## Troubleshooting Portal Malfunctions

If your portal starts making suspicious humming noises, immediately step away and offer it a compliment - most portals
are simply feeling underappreciated and will resume normal operation once their ego is properly stroked. Portals that
refuse to open despite correct spell casting usually indicate they've developed opinions about your travel destination
and are staging a protest; try bribing them with crystallized moonbeams or promising to visit somewhere more interesting
next time. The most serious malfunction occurs when portals begin opening to random locations - this typically happens
when they've been gossiping with unstable magical mirrors and should be resolved by having a stern conversation about
professional boundaries with all nearby reflective surfaces.
