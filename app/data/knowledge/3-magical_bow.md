# Magical Bow

The magical bow shoots not ordinary arrows but light charges. To function properly, it should be cleaned with a crystal
cloth and oiled with elven oil every full moon.

## Aiming and Accuracy Tips

Mastering the magical bow requires understanding that light charges don't follow traditional physics - they have a
tendency to curve toward shiny objects and completely ignore targets that are particularly grumpy. Expert archers
recommend practicing with a smile, as the bow can sense your mood and will deliberately miss if you're having a bad day.
Some bows have been known to refuse to fire at all if their owner hasn't complimented them recently, so it's wise to
tell your bow how magnificent it looks before each use.

## Common Bow Malfunctions and Solutions

If your magical bow starts shooting rainbow sparkles instead of focused light charges, it usually means it's been
spending too much time near unicorns and has caught their sense of whimsy. The cure is to let it rest in a sensible,
no-nonsense environment for a few days, preferably near some serious-looking rocks. A bow that shoots backwards
typically indicates it's developed stage fright and needs confidence-building exercises - try having it shoot at very
large, easy targets while offering plenty of encouragement. Remember, never attempt to string a magical bow with regular
bowstring, as it will immediately file a complaint with the Elven Archery Guild.
