# Morning Pine Elixir

The elixir energizes better than any coffee. It is made from pine needles, a bit of dew from the Silver River, and
slowly heated on a sunstone. It increases concentration by 30% and sometimes causes spontaneous singing.

## Brewing Techniques and Variations

The secret to perfect Morning Pine Elixir lies in the timing of the pine needle harvest - they must be collected while
still arguing with the morning breeze about which direction to point. Advanced brewers often add a whisper of
crystallized laughter (available at most elven apothecaries) which enhances the elixir's mood-lifting properties but may
cause uncontrollable giggling during important meetings. The Deluxe Pine Supreme variant includes a drop of liquid
starlight, though this version is known to make drinkers temporarily levitate three inches off the ground, which can be
inconvenient during formal dinners.

## Side Effects and Precautions

While generally safe, Morning Pine Elixir can have some unexpected effects that new users should be aware of.
Overconsumption may result in speaking exclusively in rhyme for several hours, an affliction known as "Bardic Tongue
Syndrome." Some users report temporarily seeing their own thoughts as small, glowing butterflies floating around their
heads, which is harmless but can be distracting during archery practice. It's strongly advised never to drink Pine
Elixir while operating teleportation portals, as the combination of extreme alertness and spontaneous singing has been
known to cause portals to open to random musical theater dimensions.
